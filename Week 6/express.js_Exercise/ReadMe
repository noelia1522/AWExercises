- Get yoda quotes (use filter)

- Get sheldon Quotes (use filter)

- Create a new array with just the quotes from each array (use map)

(BONUS POINTS: chain the two above actions! xxxx.filter().map();)

- Join the two arrays, mixing the different quotes (you could either merge using one from each array alternative, or concatenate both and then use sort() method to sort them alphabetically - so they are mixed, or whatever other alternative you think!)

- Then use reduce function to create a single string from a random 5 of those! Use the new line character "\n" in between each quote in order to create dialog like format. Save the output in an object with key: crazy-monolog and value: the produced string.

- Write the output in a json file.
