Functions
Question1:Create a function that returns the string "Learning is Fun!", with the return type explicitly defined:
---------- myFunc():---------- {
------ "Learning is Fun!";
}


Question2:
Part1.
Declare a varaible with its type

Variable Name	        Type	  Value
spacecraftName	        string	  'Determination'
speedMph	        number	  17500
kilometersToMars	number	  225000000
kilometersToTheMoon	number	  384400
milesPerKilometer	number	  0.621

Part 2 - Print Days to Mars

1.Declare and assign these variables.

a.Remember: variable declarations in TypeScript include the type!
b.milesToMars is a number with the value of kilometersToMars * milesPerKilometer.
c.hoursToMars is a number with the value of milesToMars / speedMph.
d.daysToMars is a number with the value of hoursToMars / 24.



2.Write a console.log statement that prints out the days to Mars.
  a. Use template literal syntax and the variables ${spacecraftName} and ${daysToMars}.
Answer:
Determination would take 332.67857142857144 days to get to Mars.

Part3.Create a Function :

1.define a function that calculates the days it would take to travel to a location.
a.Function name: getDaysToLocation
b.Parameter:kilometersAway       (must be a number).
c.Returns the number of days to a location.
     *Use the same calculations as in Part 2.1.
     *Inside the function, make the variable names generic. Use milesAway and hoursToLocation instead of milesToMars and hoursToMars.
     *The function should declare that it returns a number.

2.Print out the days to Mars.
a.Move the output statement from part 2 below your new function.
b.Refactor the template literal to use ${getDaysToLocation(kilometersToMars)} and ${spacecraftName}.

3.Print out the days to the Moon.
a.Add another output statement and template literal using ${getDaysToLocation(kilometersToTheMoon)} and ${spacecraftName}.

Answer:
Determination would take 332.67857142857144 days to get to Mars.
   Determination would take 0.5683628571428571 days to get to the Moon.
   
Question3:Create a function that specifically does not return a value

Question4:Create a function with 2 parameters (myVar1 and myVar2), that are both strings

Question5:Create a function with 2 parameters (myVar1 and myVar2,in that order), that are both strings.
Specify that myVar2 should be optional

Question6:Prevent the array from being changed:
const names: readonly string[] = ["Dylan"];
