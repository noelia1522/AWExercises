Exercise1:
In this exercise, build your own Button component and render it three times. On user click, it should alert which button was clicked:
The custom component should accept an onClick prop. On render, it should render the children betwen the button. This is the text you want for the button.
image of look alike is uplaoded namely imG1

Think of it like the HTML <button> tag. Whatever text you place between the opening and closing tag is rendered between the button when you inspect the element in your browser developer console.

On user click, it should alert which button was clicked.

Exercise2:Mapping Through A List And Rendering (With A Custom Component)
we mentioned that part of what makes React so great is that it allows us to create our custom, re-usable components.

You only created a custom button there. This time, you'll create a custom component that displays each item from List:

['dog', 'cat', 'chicken', 'cow', 'sheep', 'horse']

Instead of using the <ul> and <li> HTML tags, create a custom component that accepts a list as its prop, and renders it accordingly.

It's up to you how you want this list will look like. I decided mine to look the image-list 



What's the point of creating custom components? You'll be able to re-use them. Think of it like creating your own functions.

Instead of copy-pasting the same lines of code everywhere you need them, you put those blocks of code inside a separate function, and you just call that function whenever you need it.

This is very good practice because if you need to make changes to your code, you don't need to change it in every place where you used it. You just need to change it in one place.

That's one of the many benefits of using custom components. There are more reasons to using custom components, which needs a whole new blog post, but this is a good start.
