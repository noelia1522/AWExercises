To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.

Within the src folder, we'll create a folder named pages with several files:

src\pages\:(your folder structure will depend on your own local path)

Layout.js
Home.js
Blogs.js
Contact.js
NoPage.js
Each file will contain a very basic React component.

Now we will use our Router in our index.js file.
Use React Router to route to pages based on URL

Challenge2:
Update todo list to add seprate pages i.e Home page that can have some dummy data and then addtaskpage(only to add new tasks),taskListpage(list of all the tasks)
and use REACT Router to route between the pages
