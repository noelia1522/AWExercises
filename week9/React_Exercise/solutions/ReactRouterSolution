Explanation
We wrap our content first with <BrowserRouter>.

Then we define our <Routes>. An application can have multiple <Routes>. Our basic example only uses one.

<Route>s can be nested. The first <Route> has a path of / and renders the Layout component.

The nested <Route>s inherit and add to the parent route. So the blogs path is combined with the parent and becomes /blogs.

The Home component route does not have a path but has an index attribute. That specifies this route as the default route for the parent route, which is /.

Setting the path to * will act as a catch-all for any undefined URLs. This is great for a 404 error page.
