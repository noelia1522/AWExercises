# Test user-event

## Issue

If the initial input value is 1 character long AND the userEvent.type method changes that value to start with the same character then it will ignore the new value until it encounters a different character.

Example:

Initial input value: `'1'`
Proposed change value via `userEvent.type`: `'11123'`

The received input value will be `'23'`, rather than `'11123'`;
