# Creating a to-do list application

### In the morning, we worked on creating a "user schema" and working with mongoDB to

### insert new users to our toDoList database using the "create" method.

### we also saw how we can retrieve data from the database using the "find" or "findOne" method.

### Now it's your turn!

### Check the todolist.png image in this folder. You can see the functionality that we want to have in our application, with a focus on the backend part.

### 1. Adding task

### 2 . Remove a task

### 3 .Delete all tasks

### To implement these functionalities, first, write a schema for "task".

### In TaskController.js implement creatTask(), removeTask(), and deleteTaks().

### Add new routes and functions if necessary.
