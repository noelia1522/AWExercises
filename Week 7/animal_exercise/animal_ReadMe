Create a simple server and establish the connection with PostgresDB.
Create a database schema called “animals_exercise”
Define and create a table called animals (name, legs, species….). 
Add some constraints! Legs <=8,  animal name required, etc
Practice inserting some entries.
Query to find all the entries in the animals table. Limit results to first 3.
Query to find all entries of species “dog”. Order results by dog name. 
Try to insert an animal with 12 legs and see what happens!
Create an animal called “spiderman” of species spider, with 5 legs.
Update the entry, a spider should have 8 legs no 5!
Delete “spiderman”.

Learning about relationships:
Create another table called person (name, age, email, fav_species = the favorite animal species of the person). 
Add a constraint: Email should be unique
A person can have one pet = one of the animals in the animals table. How do you set that up? Add the appropriate column and setting.
Add new entries in the person table
Queries:
Find the owner of “spiderman”.
Find all animals ready for adoption (i.e that have no owner).
Return a new table listing all user name and emails together with their pet names.
