// This morning we started working on the "toDoList" application using
   snowpack, typescript, and axios.

// we used the following snowpack command to automatically generate the initial files, folders, and settings for the app:

npx create-snowpack-app . --template @snowpack/app-template-blank-typescript --force

//Now, we want to read data from the local txt file in "public" folder which is called
// "randomQuotes.txt". It contains an array of objects.
// Each object has 2 properties: "text" and "author".

//In a new ts file, create a function called "getQuotes". It has one parameter "author".

//       function getRandomQuotes(author: string) {
              //your code
}
//getQuotes should get the txt file using axios and save the resulted array in
// a variable. Then, it should find all of the quotes which has the same author as "author".
//For example:
// getRandomQuotes("Thomas Edison") // returns an array with length = 5. the first item in the array is:

//  {
//    author: "Thomas Edison"
//    text: "If we did the things we are capable of, we would astound ourselves."
//   }


//use axios to get the file data. use async/await when needed.
//use lodash to find the items. Does lodash "findLast" method work here? what about "find"?
//which lodash function you should use? check lodash documentation (https://lodash.com/)


//After importing the function you wrote in index.ts, call it, and log the results.
//Finally, represent text and author on the page.
