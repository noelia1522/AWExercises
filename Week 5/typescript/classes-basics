Question1:access modifiers
class Person {
  private name: string;

  public constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}

const person = new Person("Jane");
person.getName();

Question2:Specify that Person.name can only be accessed within the class, but that the method Person.getName() can be accessed anywhere:

class Person {
 
------ name: string;

 public constructor(name: string) {
  this.name = name;
 }

 
------ getName(): string {
  return this.name;
 }
}

Question3:TypeScript provides a convenient way to define class members in the constructor, by adding a visibility modifiers to the parameter.

Example
class Person {
 

  public constructor(private name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}

 }
 Question4:Create a class circle and add a static member field pi and calculate the area of a circle with a static method.
 Question5:Extend question 4 and add a non static method calculateCircumference to get the circuference of ciircle
Question6:Create a interface for Subject with the basic info that a Subject has to contain like Name, Code and Description
Create a list of subjects based on the interface
Create a method to show the list that you just created

Question7:Create a Class for Suject that implement the interface create in the last question
Implement 2 constructors
One that not receive any parameters
Other that receive as parameter “Name”, “Code”, “Description”, assigning those parameters to the field in the class.
